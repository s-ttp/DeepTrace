  "network_overview": "The capture contains a single IMS/SIP registration exchange (REGISTER-100-200) over SCTP between UE 10.235.69.1 and P-CSCF 10.235.68.66; no voice call was attempted and no RTP/media streams are present. All SIP transactions completed successfully within 129 ms, so the apparent \"FAILED\" and \"SETUP_TIMEOUT\" labels in the JSON are false positives caused by the analytics tool mis-classifying a registration-only trace as a call attempt.",
